<p><strong>Mobile Panini</strong> is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.</p> 

<p>Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud
graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.</p>

<p>Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside 
your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of preparation.
We've partnered with <em>Curbside Thai</em> to bring you the finest cuisine on 
four wheels - from the East and the West!</p>
